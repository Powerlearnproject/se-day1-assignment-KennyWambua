Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
   Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Its importance lies in ensuring that complex systems are built reliably, efficiently, and safely, meeting user requirements while minimizing cost, schedule risk, and defects. High‑quality software engineering increases productivity and reduces long‑term maintenance costs.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   1960s: Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline, addressing the “software crisis.”
   1970s: Structured programming introduction, improving code readability and maintainability.
   2000s: Rise of Agile methodologies, shifting from sequential to iterative development for faster feedback and adaptability.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Requirements Gathering: Collect and document what users need the software to do, including functional and non‑functional requirements.
   Design: Create high‑level architecture and detailed design specifications that define how the software will fulfill those requirements.
   Implementation (Coding): Translate the design into executable source code using the chosen programming language(s).
   Testing: Execute various tests (unit, integration, system, acceptance) to verify the software works correctly and meets requirements.
   Deployment: Release the finished software into the production environment for end users to access.
   Maintenance: Provide ongoing support by fixing defects, updating features, and ensuring compatibility with evolving environments.


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential model in which each phase must be completed before the next begins. This rigidity makes Waterfall well‑suited to projects with well‑defined, stable requirements and little expected change, such as developing software for regulated industries (e.g., medical devices or aerospace systems) where thorough documentation and upfront planning are critical. In contrast, Agile methodology is an iterative, incremental approach that breaks work into sprints, enabling frequent feedback, continuous delivery, and adaptation to evolving requirements. Agile is ideal for projects in fast‑changing environments like consumer web or mobile applications, where stakeholder needs may shift rapidly, and early user feedback is essential to guiding development. While Waterfall emphasizes predictability, detailed documentation, and a single final delivery, Agile prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and delivering working software in small increments.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   Software Developer: Write, debug, and document code. Implement features and perform unit tests.
   Quality Assurance Engineer: Design and execute test plans (unit, integration, system, acceptance), report defects, and verify fixes.
   Project Manager:	Define scope/schedule/budget, coordinate cross‑functional teams, and manage risks and stakeholder communication.


5. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA, provide an all‑in‑one workspace where developers can write, debug, and test code with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, integrated debugging, and refactoring assistance. By reducing manual steps and catching errors early, IDEs accelerate development and help ensure code correctness. Version Control Systems (VCS), such as Git and Subversion, track every change to source code, enable branching and merging of parallel development efforts, and maintain a complete history of who changed what and why. This safeguards against accidental data loss, facilitate collaboration among distributed teams, simplifies code reviews, and supports continuous integration workflows. 


6. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   Software engineers frequently contend with rapidly changing requirements, tight deadlines, and accumulating technical debt, which can undermine project quality and team morale. Changing requirements can lead to scope creep and rework; to address this, teams should adopt iterative practices (such as Agile sprints), maintain clear communication with stakeholders, and regularly reprioritize features. Tight deadlines often pressure developers to cut corners; mitigating this requires realistic planning and leveraging automation (for builds and testing) to reduce manual effort. Technical debt can accumulate when shortcuts are taken; preventing it involves enforcing coding standards, conducting regular code reviews, and scheduling periodic refactoring.
   

7. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Unit testing verifies the smallest pieces of code, like individual functions or classes, in isolation to ensure they behave as intended; catching bugs early at this level reduces the cost of fixes.
   Integration testing validates that multiple units work correctly together by testing interactions between modules or components, uncovering interface mismatches or data‑flow errors that unit tests cannot detect.
   System testing evaluates the complete, integrated application end‑to‑end against its functional requirements, ensuring all features operate together in the target environment.
   Acceptance testing involves stakeholders or end users verifying that the delivered software meets business needs and user expectations before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is crafting clear, specific instructions to elicit the best possible responses from AI models. It minimizes ambiguity and hallucination, ensuring outputs align with user intent.


2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   Vague Prompt: Tell me about cats.
   Improved prompt: In two sentences, explain the origin of domestic cats and one significant behavioral trait they exhibit.
   This improved prompt specifies the needed information (origin and a behavioral trait), limits the response length (two sentences), and sets clear expectations for format and content.
